Description
-----------
Script **scrape_books.py** scrapes a bookstore and creates an SQLite database with its data.

Once the database is created, **top10.py** is used to search the database and create data frames for the top 10 books for the following categories:
"TOP RATED", "BEST PRICE" and "RECOMMENDED". The data frames are then saved in an Excel file.
